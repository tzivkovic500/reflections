How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It narrowed down the search extraordinarily.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Find bugs quicker and more easily.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

I can choose the right point of time, e.g. logical unit of code completed. But I can simply forget to do it.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    The intention of using the version control is completely different. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Easyly by entering version numbers or at least some of their first letters.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

    I can easily revert back to older versions part of older versions of code.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For my Android projects.
