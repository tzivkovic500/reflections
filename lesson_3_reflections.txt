When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Working from multpile computers, share project with other people, backup matters.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I can decide on the time by myself

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forksare from one GitHub repo to another. Clones are from a remote or a local repo to a local one. Bracnhes are all within a local repo.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Can work offline. Have the latests commits with me.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

By sending emails. Replacing files directly would be easier, but also more dangerous. It would be harder to maintain an overview of all changes.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

New Features or long term things. Master brachn will stay clean on running. Just for bugfixin. Branches  will have to be merged later on.
